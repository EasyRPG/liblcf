liblcf source code generator
============================

Files in the generated subdirectory of src directory are regenerated
automatically when running the generate.py script.

These source code files are generated with the templates subfolder
structure based on the csv subfolder data files.


Requirements
------------

* Python interpreter version 2 or 3.

* CSV files can be read with any text editor or (at your option) any
  spreadsheet editor.


Usage
-----

1. Open one of the csv files in the csv subdirectory to edit or add new
   data then save file changes.

2. Run the file generate.py from the generator folder.

3. Add any new created .cpp and .h to project files if needed.

4. Recompile liblcf.
